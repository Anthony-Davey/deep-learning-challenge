I wasn't able to see meaningful changes in accuracy score though by increasing or decreasing either the number of hidden layers or the nodes within. I decided to use the relu activation function for both hidden layers and the sigmoid activation function for the final layer. I decided to choose relu because of its simplicity and speed. I chose sigmoid for the final layer's activation function since it involves a binary output on the target variable. "

    "My neural network returned an accuracy score of 73% on the optimized script, which is fairly accurate for Alphabet Soup to use when compared to a theoretical 50% random chance. Given that we have a target I would only recommend other forms of supervised learning algorithms. We also know that the target is a binary categorical variable, which would mean that we'd consider classification techniques such as random forest, SVM, or logistic regression. While we could possibly improve our neural network model, I believe that by testing other appropriate models on this data can provide insights into which model may be a better fit. "
